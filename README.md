# Backend storage - MySQL, MongoDB & Redis
This repository contains programs that were created specifically for ALX's back-end specialization track. In the course of these projects, I advanced my skill in MySQL, learned about NoSQL and practiced using MongoDB. Additionally, I gained an understanding of Redis and how to utilize it as a basic cache.
