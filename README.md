# Backend storage - MySQL, MongoDB & Redis
This repository contains programs that were created specifically for ALX's back-end specialization track. In the course of the projects, I advanced my skill in MySQL, learned about NoSQL and practiced using MongoDB. Additionally, I learned the fundamentals of Redis and how to use it as a simple cache.
